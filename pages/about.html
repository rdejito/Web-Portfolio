                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I am Randulf Cadimas, a Computer Engineering Technology student currently in my second year of a three-year diploma program. I am a Grade 12 GAS graduate with a General Weighted Average (GWA) of 90, reflecting my strong academic foundation and commitment to learning. <br><br>

                I have a growing background in both software and hardware technologies, with hands-on experience in web development, graphic design using Adobe Photoshop, computer networking, and PCB design and electronics. I enjoy learning new tools and technologies, especially those related to practical and industry-ready skills. <br><br>

                I am continuously improving my technical abilities through formal education, certifications, and training programs. My goal is to apply my skills in real-world environments, contribute to projects, and grow as a future IT and engineering professional.</p>
